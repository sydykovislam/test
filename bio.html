      <p>I (Elaman) know that I am special and there's no one else out there that's like me... so enjoy! (smile)</p> 
      <p>I was born in Karakol on May 26, 1999. I had a very simple and happy childhood, and my only sibling, my younger Brother, would appear nine years later after my own birth.</p>
      <p>Like my dad, I am introverted and am perfectly happy watching quality movies or using a personal computer during my spare time.I lived in Bishkek. For one year before I came back to Karakol, I lived in Frankfurt.</p>
